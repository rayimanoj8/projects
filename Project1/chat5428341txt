Lyra: 
The importance of what?
Manoj : importance of data structures in computer science
Lyra: 
Data structures are an important part of computer science and are used to organize and store data in an efficient manner. They are used in algorithms, data analysis, software development and many other areas. Data structures allow for efficient storage, access and manipulation of data, making them an essential part of any computer science program.

Manoj : tell me something about
Lyra: 
What would you like to know?
Manoj : about this server side programming
Lyra: 
Server-side programming refers to programming that is performed by a web server. It is used to create dynamic webpages that can respond to user input and interact with databases and other sources of information. Server-side scripting languages, such as PHP, ASP, and JSP, are used to create server-side applications that can process data from forms, provide content to users, and interact with databases.

Manoj : php or jsp
Lyra: 
Both PHP and JSP are server-side scripting languages used to create dynamic webpages. PHP is a general-purpose scripting language that is popular for web development, while JSP is a Java-based scripting language used to create Java-based applications. Each language has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to evaluate which one is best suited for your project.

Manoj : according to what is your favourite among them
Lyra: 
My favorite between PHP and JSP would have to be PHP. I find that it is easier to learn and use, and it offers a wide range of functionality. Additionally, it is more widely used, so there are more resources available on the web for learning and troubleshooting.

Manoj : how many days do you think it will be enough to learn php longest for a average problems
Lyra: 
It really depends on the individual and their level of experience. For someone with no prior experience, it typically takes at least a few weeks of practice to become comfortable with the language. For someone with some experience, it could take as little as a few days. It also depends on the difficulty of the problem and the complexity of the code.
